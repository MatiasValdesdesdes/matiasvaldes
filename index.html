                        <h2>THE STROKES</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Strokes, American rock group often credited with having spearheaded a revival of 1960s-style garage rock in the early 21st century. Although their songs hinted at a rough-and-tumble life, the Strokes were composed mainly of privileged sons of the New York City elite. Singer Julian Casablancas (b. August 23, 1978, New York, New York, U.S.), guitarist Nick Valensi (b. January 16, 1981, New York City), and drummer Fabrizio Moretti (b. June 2, 1980, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) began playing together in 1998 as schoolmates in Manhattan. Guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. (b. April 9, 1980, Los Angeles, California)—the son of British singer-songwriter Albert Hammond—and bassist Nikolai Fraiture (b. November 13, 1978, New York City) joined shortly thereafter, solidifying the Strokes as a quintet in 1999.

                        <h2>NIRVANA</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Despite a short mainstream career spanning only three years, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.
                            In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses.

                        <h2>AJR</h2>
                        <p>
                            AJR is an American indie pop band founded by brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met, collectively a trio of vocalists, multi-instrumentalists, and songwriters.[1] The brothers grew up in New York City, primarily focused on busking and singing covers until shifting to producing their albums and touring. At their home studio, AJR recorded more than 100 songs and has released five studio albums on various record labels along with their indie label.[a]
                            AJR wrote and promoted the song "I'm Ready" onto Twitter in 2012, which led to Australian singer and songwriter Sia sharing talent management network with the trio prior to the release. After the song became their breakout single on radio, AJR formed their own label AJR Productions and partnered with Warner Records to release their debut album, Living Room (2015).

                        <h2>TALLY HALL</h2>
                        <p>
                            Tally Hall (sometimes stylized as tallyhall) is an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December 2002. The band is known for upbeat melodies and whimsical lyrics. The members originally described their musical style as "wonky rock", later redefining their sound as "fabloo", in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres after critics began defining the characteristics of "wonky rock".
